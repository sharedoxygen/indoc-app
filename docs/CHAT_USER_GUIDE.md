## Welcome to inDoc Conversational Chat

inDoc's chat feature lets you have natural conversations with your document library. Ask questions, get insights, and explore your documents through an intelligent AI assistant.

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Select Your Documents

Before asking questions, select the documents you want to chat about:

1. Navigate to the **Chat** page
2. Browse your document library on the left panel
3. Check the boxes next to relevant documents (minimum 3 recommended)
4. Or use the search bar to find specific documents

**üí° Tip:** Select at least 3-5 documents for best results. The AI provides more accurate answers when it has sufficient context.

### 2. Ask Your Question

Type your question in the chat box and press Enter or click Send.

**Good Questions:**
- "What are the main points in these documents?"
- "Compare the approaches mentioned in these research papers"
- "Summarize the financial data from Q3 reports"
- "Are there any compliance issues mentioned?"

**Tips for Better Answers:**
- Be specific: "What's the revenue growth?" vs "Tell me about revenue"
- Reference document types: "Based on the PDF reports..."
- Ask follow-up questions: The AI remembers your conversation
- Use suggested questions: Click the suggested question chips

### 3. Understand the Response

Each response includes:
- **Answer:** Grounded in your selected documents
- **Sources:** Documents used to generate the answer
- **Suggested Questions:** Related follow-up questions you might ask

**Understanding Quality Indicators:**
- ‚úÖ **High Confidence:** Answer strongly supported by documents
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Verification Needed:** Some claims may need cross-checking
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Insufficient Context:** Need more documents selected

## Best Practices

### Document Selection

**Do:**
- ‚úÖ Select 3-5 related documents for focused analysis
- ‚úÖ Use search to find relevant documents first
- ‚úÖ Include variety (different perspectives, data sources)
- ‚úÖ Add more documents if answer is insufficient

**Don't:**
- ‚ùå Select only 1 document (below minimum threshold)
- ‚ùå Select unrelated documents (confuses context)
- ‚ùå Select 100+ documents (overwhelming context)

### Question Formulation

**Do:**
- ‚úÖ Ask specific, focused questions
- ‚úÖ Reference document types ("in the PDFs...")
- ‚úÖ Build on previous answers with follow-ups
- ‚úÖ Use suggested questions as starting points

**Don't:**
- ‚ùå Ask multiple unrelated questions at once
- ‚ùå Ask about information not in your documents
- ‚ùå Expect answers beyond document scope

### Conversation Management

**Do:**
- ‚úÖ Start new conversation for different topics
- ‚úÖ Use conversation history to review past discussions
- ‚úÖ Keep conversations focused on related topics
- ‚úÖ Export important conversations for reference

**Don't:**
- ‚ùå Mix unrelated topics in one conversation
- ‚ùå Expect the AI to remember conversations from weeks ago
- ‚ùå Assume AI can access documents you haven't selected

## Troubleshooting

### "I don't have enough information to answer confidently"

**Reason:** Less than 3 documents selected or documents don't contain relevant information

**Solution:**
1. Select more documents (aim for 3-5)
2. Search for documents related to your question
3. Rephrase your question to match available document content
4. Upload additional documents if needed

### "AI service temporarily unavailable"

**Reason:** Language model service is down (Ollama or OpenAI)

**Solution:**
1. Wait a moment and try again (auto-fallback in progress)
2. Use Search feature instead
3. Browse documents directly
4. Contact administrator if persists

### Response Seems Off-Topic

**Reason:** Selected documents don't match your question

**Solution:**
1. Review selected documents
2. Use search to find more relevant documents
3. Refine your question to be more specific
4. Check document content previews

### Slow Response Time

**Reason:** Large document set or complex analysis

**Solution:**
1. Reduce number of selected documents (5-10 optimal)
2. Be patient - complex analysis takes 10-20 seconds
3. Use streaming endpoint for progressive display
4. Try more specific questions (faster processing)

## FAQ

A: Not currently. If you made a typo, simply send a correction message.

A: Use Chat History to view past conversations. Export feature coming soon.
