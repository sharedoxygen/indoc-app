# Build Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Port Conflicts**
- **Grafana**: Changed from port 3000 → 3030 (conflict with Node.js)
- **Weaviate**: Changed from port 8080 → 8060 (conflict with Java process)

### 2. **PostgreSQL Configuration**
- Removed PostgreSQL from Docker Compose
- Configured to use existing localhost:5432 instance
- Updated all services to use `host.docker.internal` for Docker → localhost connections

### 3. **Celery Configuration Issues**
Fixed multiple issues preventing Celery workers from starting:

#### a. Missing Celery Configuration
- Added `CELERY_BROKER_URL` and `CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND` to `app/core/config.py`

#### b. SQLAlchemy Reserved Word Conflict
- Changed `metadata` → `document_metadata` in Document model
- Changed `metadata` → `conversation_metadata` in Conversation model
- Changed `metadata` → `message_metadata` in Message model
- Fixed relationship back_populates to match new names

#### c. Missing Imports
- Added `Boolean` import to `app/models/metadata.py`
- Fixed import path from `app.db.base_class` → `app.models.base`
- Changed `Base` → `BaseModel` in Conversation and Message models

#### d. Missing Service Files
Created placeholder services that were referenced but didn't exist:
- `app/services/text_extraction_service.py`
- `app/services/search_service.py`

#### e. Missing Relationships
- Added `conversations` relationship to User model
- Added `conversations` relationship to Document model

## Current Status

✅ **All services are now running:**
- PostgreSQL (localhost:5432) - External
- Ollama (localhost:11434) - External
- Elasticsearch (localhost:9200) - Docker
- Weaviate (localhost:8060) - Docker
- Redis (localhost:6379) - Docker
- Celery Worker - Docker
- Celery Beat - Docker
- Flower (localhost:5555) - Docker
- Prometheus (localhost:9090) - Docker
- Grafana (localhost:3030) - Docker

## Files Modified

1. `docker-compose.yml` - Port changes, removed PostgreSQL
2. `backend/app/core/config.py` - Added Celery configuration
3. `backend/app/models/document.py` - Fixed metadata relationship
4. `backend/app/models/conversation.py` - Fixed reserved words and imports
5. `backend/app/models/metadata.py` - Added Boolean import, fixed relationship
6. `backend/app/models/user.py` - Added conversations relationship
7. Created `backend/app/services/text_extraction_service.py`
8. Created `backend/app/services/search_service.py`

## How to Start Services

```bash
# Full SaaS platform with all features
make saas

# Or just Docker services
docker-compose up -d

# Check status
docker-compose ps
make health
```

## Access Points

- **Frontend**: http://localhost:5173
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:8000/api/v1/docs
- **Flower (Celery)**: http://localhost:5555
- **Grafana**: http://localhost:3030 ⚠️ (changed from 3000)
- **Prometheus**: http://localhost:9090
- **Weaviate**: http://localhost:8060 ⚠️ (changed from 8080)

## Next Steps

1. Run database migrations:
```bash
cd backend
alembic upgrade head
```

2. Start backend and frontend locally:
```bash
# Backend
cd backend
uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# Frontend (new terminal)
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

3. Test the services:
```bash
# Check Celery workers
open http://localhost:5555

# Check monitoring
open http://localhost:3030
```

## Verification

All services should show as running:
```bash
$ docker-compose ps
NAME                     STATUS
indoc-celery-beat        Up
indoc-celery-worker      Up
indoc-elasticsearch      Up (healthy)
indoc-flower             Up
indoc-grafana            Up
indoc-prometheus         Up
indoc-redis              Up (healthy)
indoc-t2v-transformers   Up
indoc-weaviate           Up
```

The build is now fixed and all services are operational!
