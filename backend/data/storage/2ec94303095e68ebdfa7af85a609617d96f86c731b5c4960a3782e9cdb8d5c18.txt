SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE DOCUMENTATION
Document Management Platform

ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW
Our document management system follows a microservices architecture with the following components:

FRONTEND LAYER
• React-based single-page application (SPA)
• TypeScript for type safety
• Redux Toolkit for state management
• Material-UI for consistent design
• Vite for fast development and building

API GATEWAY
• FastAPI framework (Python)
• JWT-based authentication
• Role-based access control (RBAC)
• Request rate limiting
• API versioning support

CORE SERVICES

Document Service
• File upload and storage management
• Metadata extraction and indexing
• Virus scanning integration
• Format conversion capabilities

Search Service
• Elasticsearch for full-text search
• Weaviate for semantic/vector search
• Hybrid search combining both approaches
• Real-time indexing pipeline

User Management Service
• User authentication and authorization
• Role and permission management
• Session management
• Audit logging

Background Processing
• Celery for asynchronous task processing
• Redis as message broker
• Document processing pipeline
• Scheduled maintenance tasks

DATA LAYER

Primary Database (PostgreSQL)
• User accounts and profiles
• Document metadata
• Conversation history
• Audit logs and compliance data

Search Indexes
• Elasticsearch: Full-text search index
• Weaviate: Vector embeddings for semantic search

Cache Layer (Redis)
• Session storage
• Frequently accessed data
• Background job queues

File Storage
• Local filesystem (development)
• S3-compatible storage (production)
• Hierarchical organization by hash

SECURITY ARCHITECTURE

Authentication & Authorization
• JWT tokens with configurable expiration
• Role-based access control (Admin, Reviewer, Uploader, Viewer, Compliance)
• API endpoint protection
• Session management

Data Protection
• Encryption at rest for sensitive fields
• TLS encryption for data in transit
• Field-level encryption for PII
• Secure file upload validation

Audit & Compliance
• Comprehensive audit logging
• Compliance reporting capabilities
• Data retention policies
• GDPR compliance features

DEPLOYMENT ARCHITECTURE

Development Environment
• Local services via Docker Compose
• Hot reloading for development
• Integrated debugging tools

Production Environment
• Kubernetes orchestration
• Horizontal pod autoscaling
• Load balancing and failover
• Monitoring and alerting

MONITORING & OBSERVABILITY

Application Monitoring
• Prometheus metrics collection
• Grafana dashboards
• Custom business metrics
• Performance monitoring

Logging
• Structured logging (JSON format)
• Centralized log aggregation
• Log retention policies
• Security event monitoring

Health Checks
• Service health endpoints
• Database connectivity checks
• External service monitoring
• Automated alerting

SCALABILITY CONSIDERATIONS

Horizontal Scaling
• Stateless API design
• Database read replicas
• Search cluster scaling
• CDN for static assets

Performance Optimization
• Database query optimization
• Caching strategies
• Asynchronous processing
• Connection pooling
